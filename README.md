# Vector Dot-Product

This README file provides an example of calculating the dot product of two vectors using code, a mathematical explanation, and a comparison of algorithm versions.

## What is a Dot Product?

The dot product is an operation that takes two equal-length sequences of numbers (usually coordinate vectors) and returns a single number. Mathematically, for two vectors **A** and **B** of length *n*:

\[
\text{Dot Product} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} A_i \times B_i
\]

## Example Code

Hereâ€™s an example code snippet in Python to compute the dot product:

```python
def dot_product(vector_a, vector_b):
    return sum(a * b for a, b in zip(vector_a, vector_b))

# Example usage
vector_a = [1, 2, 3]
vector_b = [4, 5, 6]
result = dot_product(vector_a, vector_b)
print("Dot Product:", result)
```

### Explanation:
- **Inputs**: `vector_a` and `vector_b`, each a list of numbers.
- **Output**: The dot product, calculated as the sum of element-wise products.
